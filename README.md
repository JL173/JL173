My repositories are generally public, but mostly for personal use and study.
Get in touch if anything interests you.

A number of 'successful' projects typically get ported to a Kaggle notebook, and reports are routinely linked in the ReadMe of the repository.

<!---
JL173/JL173 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
